## Features

- **Row & Line Cursors**  
  - **Row cursor** highlights the character at the cursor position using ANSI escape sequences.  
  - **Line cursor** prefixes the current line with `*` and shifts other lines by one space.
- **Basic Editing**  
  - **Insert (`i <text>`)**: Inserts `<text>` left of the cursor and moves the cursor to the start of the inserted text.  
  - **Append (`a <text>`)**: Inserts `<text>` right of the cursor and moves the cursor to the end of the inserted text.  
  - **Delete Character (`x`)**: Deletes the character at the cursor.  
  - **Delete Word (`dw`)**: Deletes from the cursor to the start of the next word or end of line.
- **Cursor Movements**  
  - **Horizontal**: `h` (left), `l` (right), `^` (start of line), `$` (end of line).  
  - **Vertical**: `j` (down), `k` (up) â€” maintains column if possible, otherwise goes to end of shorter lines.
- **Word Motions**  
  - `w`: Move to the start of the next word.  
  - `b`: Move to the start of the previous word.  
- **Line Operations**  
  - **Copy (`yy`)**: Copy the current line into the buffer.  
  - **Paste (`p`/`P`)**: Paste below (`p`) or above (`P`) the current line.  
  - **Empty Line Insert (`o`/`O`)**: Insert a blank line below (`o`) or above (`O`).  
  - **Delete Line (`dd`)**: Delete the current line.
- **History**  
  - **Undo (`u`)**: Revert the last change command.  
  - **Repeat (`r`)**: Re-execute the last change command (ignores `u`, `s`, and `?`). After an undo, repeats the command preceding the undone action.
- **Help & Quit**  
  - `?`: Show detailed help.  
  - `s`: Display current content.  
  - `q`: Quit the editor.
